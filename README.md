# Snap-Nutrient
This project is about Food Detection and Calories Estimation using YOLOv8.
 The development of Snap-Nutrient is based on several fundamental technologies
 and interdisciplinary research areas, primarily encompassing artificial intelligence,
 computer vision, and nutritional science. The project's implementation leverages
 modern advancements in real-time object detection using deep learning
 frameworks, efficient data processing pipelines, and the scientific understanding
 of food composition. By integrating these domains, Snap-Nutrient not only detects
 food items in static images and live video but also provides insightful nutritional
 breakdowns instantly, making it practical for both personal health tracking and
 dietary research.
